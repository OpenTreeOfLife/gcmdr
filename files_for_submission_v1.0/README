Files for submision of the Open Tree of Life synthesis paper.

Several files are provided:

1. taxon_all.py: a list of properly structered study_tree files for 'taxon'.
2. taxon.py: a list of studies contributing to synthesis, ordered by preference.
3. *_all_log/: newick tree files (*.tre), monophyletic status (*.inf_mono), and study info (*.log).
4. nexson_files: the nexson files used for all analyses.

Note: 'Life_v2.6_mapcompat_19April-synth_names.tree.tgz' is the same tree topology as 'Life_v2.6_mapcompat_19April-synth.tre.tgz', but with proper newick-formatted taxon names.
