Graph of Life Commander

This repo contains scripts for loading trees into treemachine, as well as lists of studies currently being incorporated into the synthetic tree. 

Files
-----

Files with taxon names (fungi.py, birds.py, etc) contain study lists for import. Studies listed in """â€¦""" comments are those that have been requested for synthesis but have not yet passed all of the import checks.

* collect\_input\_studies.py: prints a list of the json files that are currently being synthesized into the draft tree
* get\_name\_info.py: ultilty script to get information about a name from treemachine
* life.py: loads all of the studies into treemachine (imports other taxon_name.py files)
* tree\_utils.py: create consensus trees, calculate bipartitions, calculate distances

Tree identifiers
----------------

Within the lists found in the taxon files, trees (usually only one per study) are designated as "MMM_NNN" where MMM is the study id and NNN is the id of a tree within that study.
